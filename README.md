Software Design Document for The Gaming Room


The Gaming Room is a client that is interested in developing a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on their current game "Draw It or Lose It" which is available on android devices. When developing this documentation, I feel that the part I was most comfortable with is the UML diagram and description. I am most familiar with Java classes and UML compared to the intricacies of the client server pattern and distributed system. Although, by the end of the document I was somewhat fluent in the design and its complexities. I found that developing the code was much easier after first designing the software parameters using this software design document. 

If I could pick one piece of the document to revise, it would be the Executive Summary and Design Constraints sections. At first, I was unaware of the depth needed to explain the purpose and barriers within the actual project. Again though, by the end of the document, things started to reveal themselves as constraints that I had not previously figured. 

Bringing the users needs into the software design is vital for creating a end user I/O software to beging with. Especially with a design like this where the user interaction is the sole reason for the software. I was able to understand the need for updates to storage capacity because of image packs to expand the game and the needs of the client which lead me to provide an adequate reccomendation for hosting the software and which OS platform in which to develop the source code. 

Using this software design document has helped me to break down and separate problems before attacking, and increasing cohesion by grouping similar items together in sections of the document, which are strategies I will adapt and continue to use throughout my career when designing similar software applications.
